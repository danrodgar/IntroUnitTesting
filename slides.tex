\section{Assertions}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{What are Assertions?}

  An \alert{assertion} specifies a constraint over some state of computation. If it evaluates to false, it implies there exists an incorrect state in the program.
  
  Assertions: 
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item can test whether the execution state is consistent at the point of examination.
    \item are predicates involving the state variables of a program in execution.
    \item are embedded in the program text.
  \end{itemize}
  
  Assertions are part of most programming languages.
  
  \end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Assertions: History}


Hoare and Floyd started in the 60s (Hoare logic) the formal verification of programs. They introduced the concept of \emph{preconditions}, \emph{postconditions} and \emph{invariants}.

A triple describes how the execution of a piece of code changes the state of the computation:

  $[\{P\}C\{Q\}]$

\noindent where $P$ and $Q$ are assertions and $C$ is code.

\begin{itemize}
	\item $P$ precondition 
	\item $Q$ postcondition
\end{itemize}

In other words, a program behaviour can be verified using preconditions, postconditions and invariants.


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Assertions in Java}

  Assertions in Java are written as:

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=JAVA,basicstyle=\small]
  assert expression;
  \end{lstlisting}
  
  \texttt{assert} is a Java keyword and \texttt{expression} is any Boolean expression. When evaluated to \texttt{false}, an exception, \texttt{AssertionError}, will be raised. 
  
  They can also provide information for developers:
  
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=JAVA,basicstyle=\small]
  assert expression1 : expression2;
  \end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\texttt{Assert} Example}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JAVA,basicstyle=\scriptsize]
  public double avgMarks(double[] marks){
 	// Pre-condition
	assert marks.length > 0 : "Array is empty!";
   	double avg = 0;
   	for (int i = 0 ; i < marks.length; i++){
	     //Invariant	
   	     assert marks[i] >= 0 && marks[i] <= 10 : "Mark is not valid!";
   	     avg += marks[i];
   	}
   	return avg/marks.length;
   }
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\texttt{Assert} example}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JAVA,basicstyle=\scriptsize]
public class AssertionExample {
  public double avgMarks(double[] marks){
   	assert marks.length > 0 : "Array is empty!";
   	double avg = 0;
   	for (int i = 0; i < marks.length; i++) {
   	     assert marks[i] >= 0 && marks[i] <= 10 : "Mark is not valid!";
   	     avg += marks[i];
   	}
   	return avg/marks.length;
   }

  public static void main(String args[]){
   	AssertionExample e = new AssertionExample();
   	double[] marks = {10, 5, 11, 3, 2, 7.5};
   	System.out.println(e.avgMarks(marks));
   	marks = new double[0];
   	System.out.println(e.avgMarks(marks));
   }
}
\end{lstlisting}


\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{\texttt{Assert} example}

When assertions are evaluated when enabled, i.e., with the VM options \texttt{-enableassertions} or \texttt{-ea}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JAVA,basicstyle=\scriptsize]
$java -ea AssertionExample
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{./figs/assertionsExeption}
\end{center}

%assertionsExeption 

Otherwise, it will run normally as assertions are designed to be run during the testing phase or debugging.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Assertions vs Exceptions}

Assertions are designed to check the program's correctness, i.e, as \emph{preconditions}, \emph{postconditions} or \emph{invariants}.

Assertions can be used to verify the state of a program but should NOT be used to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Validate arguments of public methods
\item Substitute the \textbf{exception handling} mechanims of a programming language
\item Modify values of attributes or objects
\item Be used in production code (assertions abruptly stop the execution of a program)
\end{itemize}

Exception handling is the process of responding to the occurrence of exceptions (usually in a graceful manner so that the execution is not interrupted). In Java, this is carried out with \texttt{try() ... catch() ... finally} statements.

Although most programming languages provide assertions, unit testing is usually carried out with frameworks such as jUnit (Java) or pyest (Python).

  \centering \url{https://www.junit.org/}
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
    \item JUnit is the most popular open source unit testing framework in Java.
    \item JUnit is a regression testing framework.
    \item Created in 1997 by Erich Gamma and Kent Beck.
    \item Simple framework with a small learning curve.
    \item Tests can be automated (facilitates regression testing). It allow us to aggregate tests via test suites.
    \item \textit{De facto} standard, integrated with Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. Typically run with continuous integration testing tools.

% \begin{frame}{JUnit 3 - (Obsolete)}

% There are still a lot of test cases and frameworks that use JUnit 3 or 4. We briefly describe how to do test cases with JUnit 3 and 4 to understand them (But we will only work with JUnit 5).

% JUnit 3 was based on inheritance and name conventions (it is common to still use them). With JUnit 3, we needed to create test classes as follows:

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Add \texttt{JUnit3<version>.jar} to the \texttt{classpath}
%   \item Create a subclass extending the \texttt{TestCase} class provided by JUnit
%   \item Define one or more public \texttt{testXXX()} methods in the subclass.
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item Write assert methods inside the \texttt{testXXX()} methods to compare actual results (obtained from the CUT) with the expected results (the oracle)
%   \end{itemize}
%   \item Optionally, define \texttt{main()} to run the TestCase in batch mode (test runner)
% \end{itemize}


% \end{frame}

% \begin{lstlisting}[language=Java,basicstyle=\scriptsize]
% import junit.framework.TestCase;

% public class MinimalTest extends TestCase {

%   public MinimalTest(String name) {

%   // Test method
%   public void testCUT () {
%     int expected = 2; //expected result
%     int actual = new CUT(); //get the actual result from CUT
%     assertTrue(actual, expected);
%   }
%   // Not needed, it's possible to use Test runner
%   public static void main(String[] args){
%     junit.textui.TestRunner.run(MinimalTest.class);
%   }
% }
% \end{lstlisting}

% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% % \begin{frame}[fragile]{JUnit 3 (Obsolete) - Characteristics}

% % Fixtures are used to initialize and release common test data, this is done with \texttt{setUp()} and \texttt{tearDown()}.

% % \begin{itemize}
% %     \item \texttt{setUp()} is used for setting things up before \textbf{each} test
% %     \item \texttt{tearDown()} for tearing things down after \textbf{each} test
% % \end{itemize}
  
% % Suites can contain multiple test cases: \texttt{addTest(Test test)}

% % \begin{lstlisting}[language=JAVA,basicstyle=\scriptsize]
% %   public static void main (String [] args){
% %     junit.textui.TestRunner.run (suite ());

\subsection{JUnit 4}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{JUnit 4}

JUnit 4 took advantage of imports and annotations included in JDK 5+.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Static imports. It allow us to make use of static variables and methods from other classes without qualifying them (name the class).
  \item Annotations 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Annotations are metadata that provide information to the compiler (or other tools)
    \item JUnit 4 works with annotations instead of extending classes. There is no need for naming conventions as in previous versions but those naming patterns are still used. 
  \end{itemize}
  \item JUnit4 also improved the functionality with annotations
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Timeouts: \texttt{@Test(timeout=1000)}...
    \item Testing exceptions: \texttt{@Test(expected=DBConnectException.class)} 
    \item Ignore a test: \texttt{@Ignore("Ignore the following test for now")}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Junit 4 -- Annotations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{@Before} A method marked with \texttt{@Before} will be run before every test method. It is used to prepare the tests environment.
  \item \texttt{@After}
  \item \texttt{@Test} Identifies a test method.
  \item \texttt{@Ignore} The method under test will be ignored (to disable some tests which we do not want to repeat)
  \item \texttt{@AfterClass} Run only once after all test methods
  \item \texttt{@BeforeClass}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{JUnit 5}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Junit 5 -- Annotations}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{@BeforeEach} A method marked with \texttt{@BeforeEach} will be run before every test method. It is used to prepare the tests environment.
    \item \texttt{@AfterEach} It will be run after every test method.
    \item \texttt{@Test} Identifies a test method.
    \item \texttt{@Ignore} The method under test will be ignored (to disable some tests which we do not want to repeat)
    \item \texttt{@AfterAll} Run only once after all test methods
    \item \texttt{@BeforeAll} Run only once before all test methods
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Junit 5 -- Assert methods}

Assert methods are used to comparison between an expected value and an actual value to determine the success or failure of a test.
  
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{assertCONDITION(...)}
        \item \texttt{assertCONDITION(String message,...)} - The message is displayed when the assert method fails
      \end{itemize}
  
For example:

      \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{assertEquals(<> expected, <> actual)}
        \item \texttt{assertSame(...)} 
        \item \texttt{assertFalse(boolean condition)}
        \item \texttt{assertTrue(boolean condition)}
        %\item \texttt{assertNull(...)}
        %\item \texttt{assertNotNull(...)}
        \item Etc.
      \end{itemize}

Further information in the API: \texttt{org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions}

%\url{https://junit.org/junit5/}
  
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Junit 5 -- New functionality I}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Custom display names - The \texttt{@DisplayName} annotation allows us to provide custom display names for test classes and methods, which can include spaces, special characters, and emojis.
  
    \item Nested test classes - Non-static nested classes (i.e., inner classes) can serve as \texttt{@Nested} test classes for logical grouping of test cases. 
  
    \item Tagging and filtering - It is possible to tag test classes and test methods with your identifiers using the \texttt{@Tag} annotation. 
  
    \item Meta-annotations and composed annotations - This allows us to create a custom composed annotation that will inherit the semantics of its meta-annotations.
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Junit 5 -- New functionality II}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Dynamic tests - JUnit Jupiter introduces dynamic tests which are generated at runtime by a factory method annotated with the \texttt{@TestFactory} annotation.
  
    \item Repeated tests - Tests can be repeated a specified number of times by annotating the test method with the \texttt{@RepeatedTest} annotation.
  
    \item Parameterized tests - A test can be run multiple times with different arguments by annotating the test method with the \texttt{@ParameterizedTest} annotation.
    % and declaring at least one source to provide the arguments. 
  \end{itemize}

  We can destroy all previously created classes with the annotation \texttt{@After} before a method, usually named \texttt{tearDown()}.
  
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Java,basicstyle=\tiny]
  @After
  public void tearDown() throws Exception {
    cOneZero = null;
    cZeroOne = null;
    cOneOne = null;
  }
  \end{lstlisting}
  
  This method destroys the classes before each test is executed.

Now we can write unit tests:
~

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java,basicstyle=\tiny]
  @Test  
  public void testGetReal() {
    System.out.println("getReal");
    double expResult = 0.0;
    double result = cZeroOne.getReal();
    assertEquals(expResult, result);
  }
  @Test
  public void testAdd() {
    System.out.println("add");
    ComplexNumber result = cZeroOne.add(cOneZero);
    assertEquals(cOneOne, result);

\section{Advanced Topics}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Testing Suites}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Suites}

Run different sets of unit tests

Using \texttt{@Suite} annotation

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java,basicstyle=\scriptsize]  
import org.junit.platform.suite.api.IncludeTags;
import org.junit.platform.suite.api.SelectPackages;
import org.junit.platform.suite.api.Suite;

@SelectPackages({"uah.packageA"
                ,"uah.packageB"})

@IncludeTags("production")
@Suite
public class JUnit5TestSuiteExample {
}
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Testing Exceptions}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Exceptions}

  The coefficient $a$ must not be zero. Therefore, the following code:
  
  \texttt{instance = new QuadraticEquation(0,1,1);}
  
  will throw an exception when executing:
  
  \texttt{boolean result = instance.checkCoefficientsAreOk();}
  
  This is tested with the annotation \texttt{@Test(expected=CoefficientsException.class)}.
  
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=JAVA,basicstyle=\scriptsize]
      @Test(expected=CoefficientsException.class)
      public void testCheckCoefficientsAreOkException() throws CoefficientsException {
          System.out.println("checkCoefficientsAreOk with Exception raised");
          QuadraticEquation instance;
          instance = new QuadraticEquation(0,1,1);
          boolean result = instance.checkCoefficientsAreOk();
      }
  \end{lstlisting}
  
  \end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Testing Private Methods}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Testing Private Methods}

In general private methods are not tested directly (they are tested indirectly through other public methods). However, if there is a need to do there are several alternatives:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Change the visibility (make them public) temporarily. However, this changes the original program and does not follow the criteria of keeping tests and source code independently.
 \item Use Java reflection mechanisms
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Testing Private Methods - Example}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java,basicstyle=\tiny]
    public void testComputeDiscriminant() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("checkCoefficientsAreOk");
         Class c = null;
         Object ins = new QuadraticEquation(1,1,1);
         Method m = null;
         c = Class.forName("example.QuadraticEquation");
         m = c.getDeclaredMethod("computeDiscriminant");
         // Remove private access restriction:
         m.setAccessible(true);
         Object res = m.invoke(ins);
         Double result = (Double)res;
         System.out.println(result);
         double expectedResult = -3.0;
         assertEquals(result.doubleValue(), expectedResult);
    }
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Parametrized tests}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Parametrized tests}

The parametrized test is an automated test in which the parameters change automatically.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Parametrized tests - Example}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java,basicstyle=\tiny]
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collection;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.junit.runners.Parameterized;
import org.junit.runners.Parameterized.Parameters;

//@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
@RunWith(Parameterized.class)
public class QuadraticEquationparTest {
  private QuadraticEquation qe;

  private Double coeficient;

  //Constructor
  public QuadraticEquationparTest(Double coeficient) {
    this.coeficient = coeficient;

  @Parameters //Definition of the parameters.
  public static Collection<Double[]> data() {
    Double[][] data = new Double[][] { {1.0}, {2.0}, {3.0}, {4.0} , {14.0} };
  return Arrays.asList(data);

  boolean result = qe.checkCoefficientsAreOk();
  assertEquals(expResult, result);

\section{Testing with Mock Objects}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Mock Objects}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{What are Mock objects?}


Sometimes tests need to be carried out without having all objects implemented or the instantiation of all needed classes is very expensive (e.g., when dealing with databases)

Advantages of using mock objects include:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Easy to instantiate
 \item If a CUT fails, the failure is located in the CUT, never in the mock!
 \item They allow us to reduce the testing time with simpler and faster classes
\end{itemize}

In Java, well-known frameworks include: Mockito, JMock and Easymock.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Process}

Process to create mock objects

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Create the necessary Mock objects
 \item Define their behaviour, establishing expectations
 \item Create CUT instances using the mock objects
 \item Run the test methods 
 \item Check with the mock objects if expectations were fulfilled. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Testing with Mockito}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

''Mockito is a mocking framework that tastes really good. It lets you write beautiful tests with clean \& simple API. Mockito doesn't give you hangover because the tests are very readable and they produce clean verification errors.''


\url{https://site.mockito.org/}

With mock objects and Mockito we can do:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Test the behaviour
  \item Force the behaviour
  \item Use matchers in arguments passing
  \item Call order verification
  \item Etc.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{Installing Mockito}

Mockito is usually used via Maven or Gradle to handle the dependencies.

%\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML,basicstyle=\tiny]
%   <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-core -->
%   <dependency>
%       <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
%       <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
%       <version>4.1.0</version>
%       <scope>test</scope>
%   </dependency>
%\end{lstlisting}

\url{https://site.mockito.org/}

Manually, it is always possible to include the \texttt{.jar} file into your project.

\end{frame}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Summary}

JUnit is a must in software engineering. 

It can be used in combination with other frameworks such as Mockito, EasyMock, etc.

It should be part of the software development life cycle with:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Continuous integration
  \item Configuration management, e.g., Git.
  \item etc.
\end{itemize}

% \section{Testing with Mock Objects}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \subsection{Mock Objects}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \begin{frame}{What are Mock objects?}


% Sometimes tests need to be carried out without having all objects implemented or the instantiation of all needed classes is very expensive (e.g., when dealing with databases)

% Advantages of using mock objects include:

% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Easy to instantiate
%  \item If a CUT fails, the failure is located in the CUT, never in the mock!
%  \item They allow us to reduce the testing time with simpler and faster classes
% \end{itemize}

% In Java, well-known frameworks include: Mockito, JMock and Easymock.

% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \begin{frame}{Process}

% Process to create mock objects

% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item Create the necessary Mock objects
%  \item Define their behaviour, establishing expectations
%  \item Create CUT instances using the mock objects
%  \item Run the test methods 
%  \item Check with the mock objects if expectations were fulfilled. 
% \end{enumerate}

% \end{frame}


% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \subsection{Testing with Mockito}


% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \begin{frame}

% ''Mockito is a mocking framework that tastes really good. It lets you write beautiful tests with clean \& simple API. Mockito doesn't give you hangover because the tests are very readable and they produce clean verification errors.''

% Web: \texttt{https://site.mockito.org/}
% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \begin{frame}[fragile]
% With Mockito we can use mock objects in unit tests to test classes simulating their behaviour with mock objects.

% Some internet examples:

% \begin{lstlisting}[language=Java,basicstyle=\tiny]
% public class MyServiceTest extends UnitilsJUnit4 {
%     private Mock<MyService> myServiceMock;
% }

% @Before
% public void initialize() {
%     myServiceMock = new MockObject<MyService>(MyService.class, this);
% }
% \end{lstlisting}
% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \begin{frame}
% With mock objects and Mockito we can do:

%   \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Test the behaviour
%   \item Force the behaviour
%   \item Use matchers in arguments passing
%   \item Call order verification
%   \item Etc.
%   \end{enumerate}
% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


% \begin{frame}{Installing Mockito}

% Download Mockito:

% \texttt{\url{https://site.mockito.org/}}

% and include the \texttt{.jar} file into your project.

% ~

% Or use Maven or Gradle to handle the dependencies.

% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% % \begin{frame}

% % The process is similar as in JUnit:
% % \begin{enumerate}
% %  \item Open the project properties
% %  \item Click on Java Build Path
% %  \item Select the Libraries tab
% %  \item Click the Add External \texttt{.jar} button
% %  \item Choose your mockito \texttt{.jar} library.
